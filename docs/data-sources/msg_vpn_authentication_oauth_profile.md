## Schema

### Required

- `msg_vpn_name` (String) The name of the Message VPN.

The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is "vpn/read-only".
- `oauth_profile_name` (String) The name of the OAuth profile.

The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is "vpn/read-only".

### Read-Only

- `authorization_groups_claim_name` (String) The name of the groups claim. If non-empty, the specified claim will be used to determine groups for authorization. If empty, the authorization_type attribute of the Message VPN will be used to determine authorization.

The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is "vpn/read-only". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is "vpn/read-write". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `"groups"`.

The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is "vpn/read-only". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is "vpn/read-write". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `"single"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:

<pre>
"single" - When the claim is a string, it is interpreted as as single group.
"space-delimited" - When the claim is a string, it is interpreted as a space-delimited list of groups, similar to the "scope" claim.
