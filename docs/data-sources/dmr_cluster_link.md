- `egress_flow_window_size` (Number) The number of outstanding guaranteed messages that can be sent over the Link before acknowledgment is received by the sender. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `255`.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable the Link. When disabled, subscription sets of this and the remote node are not kept up-to-date, and messages are not exchanged with the remote node. Published guaranteed messages will be queued up for future delivery based on current subscription sets. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
- `initiator` (String) The initiator of the Link's TCP connections. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change.

- `queue_max_ttl` (Number) The maximum time in seconds a message can stay in the Queue when `queue_respect_ttl_enabled` is `true`. A message expires when the lesser of the sender assigned time-to-live (TTL) in the message and the `queue_max_ttl` configured for the Queue, is exceeded. A value of 0 disables expiry. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `0`.
- `queue_reject_msg_to_sender_on_discard_behavior` (String) Determines when to return negative acknowledgments (NACKs) to sending clients on message discards.

The default value is `"always"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:

- `span` (String) The span of the Link, either internal or external. Internal Links connect nodes within the same Cluster. External Links connect nodes within different Clusters. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `"external"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:

<pre>
