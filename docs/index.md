# Solace PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance (solacebrokerappliance) Provider

This provider specifically supports the configuration of Solace PubSub+ Appliances. The provider for the Solace Software Event Broker (solacebroker) is available from [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/solaceproducts/solacebroker/latest).

The [Solace PubSub+ Platform](https://solace.com/products/platform/)'s [PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance](https://solace.com/products/event-broker/appliance/)
efficiently streams event-driven information between applications, IoT devices and user interfaces running in cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments 
using open APIs and protocols like AMQP, JMS, MQTT, REST and WebSocket.

Appliances in multiple locations can be linked together in an [Event Mesh](https://solace.com/what-is-an-event-mesh/) 
to dynamically share events across the distributed enterprise.

## Overview

The _solacebrokerappliance_ provider enables you to configure a PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance using Terraform.

-> This _solacebrokerappliance_ provider uses the same [preferred local name](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements#local-names) `"solacebroker"` as 
the [_solacebroker_ provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/solaceproducts/solacebrokerappliance/latest).
This allows Terraform modules to be written that can target either provider. Note that such modules must only use features that are available in both providers.

This provider also offers the possibility to generate an [HCL configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language) file from a preconfigured appliance.

Use the navigation to the left for more information in the guides and for the available provider resources and data sources.

## Limitations

> This version of the PubSub+ Terraform provider is generally available for production services contained within a Message VPN.  Use of any resource not contained within a Message VPN is not supported in production by Solace.

## Minimum appliance version

The minimum required PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance version is 10.4.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    solacebroker = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/solaceproducts/solacebrokerappliance"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the provider
provider "solacebroker" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "admin"
  url      = "http://appliance_url:80"
}

# Create a message-vpn on the event broker
resource "solacebroker_msg_vpn" "test" {
  msg_vpn_name        = "new"
  enabled             = true
  max_msg_spool_usage = 10
}

# Create a messaging queue - notice the dependency on message-vpn
resource "solacebroker_msg_vpn_queue" "q" {
  msg_vpn_name    = solacebroker_msg_vpn.test.msg_vpn_name
  queue_name      = "green"
  ingress_enabled = true
  egress_enabled  = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `url` (String) The base URL of the event broker, for example `https://mybroker.example.org:<semp-service-port>/`. The trailing / can be omitted.

### Optional

- `bearer_token` (String, Sensitive) A bearer token that will be sent in the Authorization header of SEMP requests. Requires TLS transport enabled. Conflicts with username and password.
- `insecure_skip_verify` (Boolean) Disable validation of server SSL certificates, accept/ignore self-signed. The default value is false.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password to connect to the broker with. Requires username and conflicts with bearer_token.
- `request_min_interval` (String) A [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration) string indicating the minimum interval between requests; this serves as a rate limit. This setting does not apply to retries. Set to 0 for no rate limit. The default value is 100ms (which equates to a rate limit of 10 calls per second).
- `request_timeout_duration` (String) A [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration) string indicating the maximum time to wait for a SEMP request.  The default value is 1m.
- `retries` (Number) The number of retries for a SEMP call. The default value is 10.
- `retry_max_interval` (String) A [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration) string indicating the maximum retry interval. The default value is 30s.
- `retry_min_interval` (String) A [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration) string indicating how long to wait after an initial failed request before the first retry.  Exponential backoff is used, up to the limit set by retry_max_interval. The default value is 3s.
- `skip_api_check` (Boolean) Disable validation of the broker SEMP API for supported platform and minimum version. The default value is false.
- `username` (String) The username to connect to the broker with.  Requires password and conflicts with bearer_token.

-> All provider configuration values can also be set as environment variables with the same name, but uppercase and with the `SOLACEBROKER_` prefix.
For example, the password attribute can be set via the `SOLACEBROKER_PASSWORD` environment variable.  Values in the configuration take precedence over environment variables.
