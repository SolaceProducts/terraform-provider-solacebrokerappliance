# solacebroker_msg_vpn_telemetry_profile (Resource)

Using the Telemetry Profile allows trace spans to be generated as messages are processed by the broker. The generated spans are stored persistently on the broker and may be consumed by the Solace receiver component of an OpenTelemetry Collector.



The minimum access scope/level required to perform this operation is "vpn/read-only".

This has been available since SEMP API version 2.31.

The import identifier for this resource is `{msg_vpn_name}/{telemetry_profile_name}`, where {&lt;attribute&gt;} represents the value of the attribute and it must be URL-encoded.
