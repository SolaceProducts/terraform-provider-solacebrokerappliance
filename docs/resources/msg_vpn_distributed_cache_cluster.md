# solacebroker_msg_vpn_distributed_cache_cluster (Resource)

A Cache Cluster is a collection of one or more Cache Instances that subscribe to exactly the same topics. Cache Instances are grouped together in a Cache Cluster for the purpose of fault tolerance and load balancing. As published messages are received, the message broker message bus sends these live data messages to the Cache Instances in the Cache Cluster. This enables client cache requests to be served by any of Cache Instances in the Cache Cluster.



The minimum access scope/level required to perform this operation is "vpn/read-only".

This has been available since SEMP API version 2.11.

The import identifier for this resource is `{msg_vpn_name}/{cache_name}/{cluster_name}`, where {&lt;attribute&gt;} represents the value of the attribute and it must be URL-encoded.
