## Schema

### Required

- `cert_authority_name` (String) The name of the Certificate Authority.

### Optional

- `cert_content` (String) The PEM formatted content for the trusted root certificate of a client Certificate Authority. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `""`.
- `crl_day_list` (String) The scheduled CRL refresh day(s), specified as "daily" or a comma-separated list of days. Days must be specified as "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", or "Sat", with no spaces, and in sorted order from Sunday to Saturday. The empty-string ("") can also be specified, indicating no schedule is configured ("crl_time_list" must also be configured to the empty-string). Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `"daily"`.
- `crl_time_list` (String) The scheduled CRL refresh time(s), specified as "hourly" or a comma-separated list of 24-hour times in the form hh:mm, or h:mm. There must be no spaces, and times (up to 4) must be in sorted order from 0:00 to 23:59. The empty-string ("") can also be specified, indicating no schedule is configured ("crl_day_list" must also be configured to the empty-string). Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `"3:00"`.
- `crl_url` (String) The URL for the CRL source. This is a required attribute for CRL to be operational and the URL must be complete with http:// included. IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square-brackets. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as revocation_check_enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `""`.
- `ocsp_non_responder_cert_enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable allowing a non-responder certificate to sign an OCSP response. Typically used with an OCSP override URL in cases where a single certificate is used to sign client certificates and OCSP responses. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
- `ocsp_override_url` (String) The OCSP responder URL to use for overriding the one supplied in the client certificate. The URL must be complete with http:// included. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `""`.
- `ocsp_timeout` (Number) The timeout in seconds to receive a response from the OCSP responder after sending a request or making the initial connection attempt. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `5`.
- `revocation_check_enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable Certificate Authority revocation checking. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
