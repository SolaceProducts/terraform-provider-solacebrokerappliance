# solacebroker_msg_vpn_topic_endpoint (Resource)

A Topic Endpoint attracts messages published to a topic for which the Topic Endpoint has a matching topic subscription. The topic subscription for the Topic Endpoint is specified in the client request to bind a Flow to that Topic Endpoint. Queues are significantly more flexible than Topic Endpoints and are the recommended approach for most applications. The use of Topic Endpoints should be restricted to JMS applications.



The minimum access scope/level required to perform this operation is "vpn/read-only".

This has been available since SEMP API version 2.4.

The import identifier for this resource is `{msg_vpn_name}/{topic_endpoint_name}`, where {&lt;attribute&gt;} represents the value of the attribute and it must be URL-encoded.
