# solacebroker_msg_vpn_mqtt_session (Resource)

An MQTT Session object is a virtual representation of an MQTT client connection. An MQTT session holds the state of an MQTT client (that is, it is used to contain a client's QoS 0 and QoS 1 subscription sets and any undelivered QoS 1 messages).



The minimum access scope/level required to perform this operation is "vpn/read-only".

This has been available since SEMP API version 2.4.

The import identifier for this resource is `{msg_vpn_name}/{mqtt_session_client_id}/{mqtt_session_virtual_router}`, where {&lt;attribute&gt;} represents the value of the attribute and it must be URL-encoded.

<pre>
"primary" - The MQTT Session belongs to the primary virtual router.

- `queue_max_msg_spool_usage` (Number) The maximum message spool usage allowed by the MQTT Session Queue, in megabytes (MB). A value of 0 only allows spooling of the last message received and disables quota checking.

The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is "vpn/read-only". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is "vpn/read-write". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as queue_reject_low_priority_msg_enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change.

<pre>
"never" - Silently discard messages.
