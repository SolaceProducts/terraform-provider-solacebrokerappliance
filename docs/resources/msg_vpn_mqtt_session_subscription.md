The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is "vpn/read-only". The allowed values and their meaning are:

<pre>
"primary" - The MQTT Session belongs to the primary virtual router.
"backup" - The MQTT Session belongs to the backup virtual router.
"auto" - The MQTT Session is automatically assigned a virtual router at creation, depending on the broker's active-standby role.
