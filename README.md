This provider, maintained by Solace, is a plugin for Terraform that enables you to configure PubSub+ Event Broker Appliances.

The provider is available from the [Terraform Providers Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/solaceproducts/solacebrokerappliance/latest).

The minimum required PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance version is 10.4.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have admin access to a Solace PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance.
2. Install the [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
3. Create the [`examples/sampleconfig.tf`](examples/sampleconfig.tf) sample file in a new directory, adjust the `url`, and the management credential parameters `username` and `password` to your broker's setup.
4. From this directory run `terraform plan`, then `terraform apply` (if prompted, `terraform init` may also be required).
5. Open the `url` link in your browser to access the broker's web management UI. The credentials are the same as used in the Terraform config. Observe the new objects created: a new Message VPN and a messaging queue under that Message VPN.
6. Run `terraform destroy` from your command line and observe that the Message VPN is deleted.
   
Note that the provider also offers the unique ability to generate a config file from an existing broker. For more information, refer to the [full documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/solaceproducts/solacebrokerappliance/latest/docs).

## Documentation

Full documentation is available on the [Terraform Providers Registry website](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/solaceproducts/solacebrokerappliance/latest/docs).

We recommended that you familiarize yourself with Solace technology and broker management. For more information, refer to the [Resources section](#resources).

## Development

### Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (>= 1.0)
* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.20)
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Building

1. `git clone` this repository and `cd` into its directory.
2. `make install` will trigger the Golang build of the provider in your [`${GOBIN}`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies) (defaults to `${GOPATH}/bin` or `${HOME}/go/bin` if `${GOPATH}` is not set). Repeat
this every time you make changes to the provider locally.

The provided `makefile` defines additional commands that are useful during development.

### Using a Development Build

Create or update your `${HOME}/.terraformrc` (Unix) / `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc` (Windows) configuration with a `provider_installation` section that contains the following `dev_overrides`:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "registry.terraform.io/solaceproducts/solacebrokerappliance" = "${GOBIN}" //< replace `${GOBIN}` with the actual path on your system
  }

  direct {}
}
```

Note that it is also possible to use a dedicated Terraform configuration file and invoke `terraform` while setting
the environment variable `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=my_terraform_config_file`.

Once the `dev_overrides` are in place, any local execution of `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` will
use the version of the provider found in the given `${GOBIN}` directory, instead of the one indicated in your terraform configuration.
